# `.`Files

Collection of my `.`Files folowing [Dominik's](https://github.com/dhabersack/dotfiles) example.


## Installation
Checkout the repository into your home folder. Keep in mind your existing configuration files could be *overwritten*!

## Configuration
To let alias and exports work with `zsh` and `bash` the `.rc` is loaded in both. It contains all agnostic configurations. To avoid commiting secrets a `.rc_secret` is sourced inside the `.rc`.
